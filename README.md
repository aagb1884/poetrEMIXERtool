# poetrEMIXER tools

This is a simple web app intended to break down texts into individual words or letters, intended for poets to begin remixing existing texts.

## Algorithms and Taggers

For most of the text filters and manipulators I created functions and algorithms in Javascript. For detecting word types I used [wink-pos-tagger](https://winkjs.org/wink-pos-tagger/), although as it has some trouble detecting adjectives.
